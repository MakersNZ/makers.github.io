# WiP (re)port of the NZ Makers Map (development reachable via makers.github.io)

A collation & aggregation of publicly available data on:
* **Places** - MakerSpaces, HackerSpaces, Community Hubs, etc
* **Groups** - Organizations aligned with the (for now, local) Makers-movement; inclusive & exclusive, public & private, FP & NFP
* **People** - Local people/players of note doing stuff. (please see privacy comments below)
* **Events** - Activities relating to the local Makers-scene

The project stemmed from a need that people wanted to set up Maker-related \*Spaces, etc, but felt isolated & had nowhere to begin, and was unare of what was already happening in their neck-of-the-woods, or were unable to find resources better suited to their needs.  

This is a tool intended to MAP(!) out what's out there in an attempt to getter get people in touch, but doing in such a manner that we respect the various entities' autonomy & agency, NOT trying to take OVER what they are already going (quite well), but collect publicly-available or volunteered information & put it all on a searchable map for people to find useful.

We would like to invite participation re this resource, so that we can build a more complete pucture, fostering better collaboration.

This is the 4th (5th?) incarnation or attempt at building this, so the more the merrier.  
Going back to some basics, cobbling resources together.
